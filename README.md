### Wondering what to hack on, or how?

See our [resources wiki project][resources] if you're looking for inspiration
or first steps at getting started with a new technology.

### Tips

Waffle is tightly integrated with GitHub issues. If you want to know about new
ideas that other members post, you can watch the repository on GitHub to get
email notifications, and reply to the emails to comment on a conversation. You
can also subscribe to an issue without needing to leave a comment.

Label your card/issue with `help wanted` or `sharing` if you're looking to
learn or share knowledge, respectively.

You can apply the `ready` label to an issue on GitHub to automatically move its
card to the **Ready** column on the Waffle board.

Close the issue for your idea on GitHub and it will be moved to **Done** on
Waffle.
