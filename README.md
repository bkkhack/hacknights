## BKK/hack Hack Nights

The BKK/hack community uses this repository as a means of organizing interest
groups ([Birds of a Feather]) for [our hack nights] in advance.

Meetup doesn't have a good built-in tool for this and we didn't want everyone
to need yet another service account, but we figure that most of our members use
GitHub already. So, we're experimenting with this approach along with a [Waffle
board] to visualize.

### Wondering what to hack on, or how?

See our [resources wiki project][resources] if you're looking for inspiration
or first steps at getting started with a new technology.

### How does it work?

Ideas are actually tracked as GitHub issues, but the [Waffle board] is an
easier interface for browsing. You can use the filter function at top right to
select a milestone, which we will create for each upcoming hack night by date.
Leave a comment on a card if you're interested in collaborating on someone's
idea.

1. If you have an idea or subject that you want to learn about or share with
   others, click `Add Issue` at the top and a card will be added to the
   **Ideas/Expertise** column.
1. Set the `Milestone` to the upcoming hack night date that you plan to attend.
   If your plans change, you can always move the milestone to the next event.
1. Move your card to the **Ready** column if you've formed a team for a date,
   or have decided to forge ahead on your own.
1. When you start working during hack night, move your card to **Happening
   Now!** so that undecided members can find and join you.
1. When the hack night is over, move your cards to **Done**.

   We like to hear about what you've learned or accomplished, so if you're not
   shy to share publicly, make a comment on your card to keep a record!

### Tips

Waffle is tightly integrated with GitHub issues. If you want to know about new
ideas that other members post, you can watch the repository on GitHub to get
email notifications, and reply to the emails to comment on a conversation. You
can also subscribe to an issue without needing to leave a comment.

Label your card/issue with `help wanted` or `sharing` if you're looking to
learn or share knowledge, respectively.

You can apply the `ready` label to an issue on GitHub to automatically move its
card to the **Ready** column on the Waffle board.

Close the issue for your idea on GitHub and it will be moved to **Done** on
Waffle.
